[Download Windows beta 1.8.1.1](https://github.com/townlight/townlight/releases/download/townlight-windows-v1.8.1.1/Townlight-Windows-x64-1.8.1.1.msi) · [Public announcement](https://townlight.github.io/announcement.html) · [Support and feedback](https://townlight.github.io/support.html)

Windows 1.8.1.1 has fresh-install acceptance. An in-place upgrade to 1.8.1.1 was not exercised. The previous Windows 1.8.0.1 release tested upgrade from 1.7.2.1; that result applies to 1.8.0.1. Before an existing-city evaluation, back up city data and settings, close Townlight, keep the existing %LOCALAPPDATA%\CivicSuite profile, and use the same Windows account. Keep the prior installer and a restore path. Station continues to use its separately configured service.

# Townlight — Townlight Beta 1

## Shared meeting imports · Windows 1.8.1.1

Windows 1.8.1.1 adds shared meeting imports for 31 source families, with 34 supported source/format pairs. Installed Windows Sandbox checks exercised preview, save and durable readback using public captures and fixtures, plus the documented Townlight handoffs. These checks do not establish automatic discovery on every live portal or a complete retest of every module.

The accepted MSI contains Townlight Runtime 0.3.1 and Meetings 1.0.6 distributions. Its health version strings still report Runtime 0.3.0 and Meetings 1.0.5. Default-branch source corrects those display strings; the signed MSI and its exact build source remain unchanged.

Planning, Permitting, Inspections, Station, Boards & Commissions, Contracts, and Procurement.

Windows 1.8.1.1 acceptance includes the configured Station worker processing a public Wistia MP4 and attaching its output to Records. Historical Station delivery evidence does not establish live broadcast, external upload or city deployment acceptance for this MSI.


## Separately deployed resident portal beta

[Portal release and downloads](https://github.com/townlight/townlight/releases/tag/townlight-beta-1-resident-portal) · [Portal guide](https://townlight.github.io/manuals/portal.html). Includes the approved city-facing website and the Meetings → Station → Records publication workflow. Deploy the portal and matching native bridge separately; the portal and bridge use their own release and deployment steps. Acceptance uses synthetic data; CivicCast remains separate.
