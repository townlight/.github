The signed Windows x64 beta 1.7.2.1 passed fresh Windows Sandbox acceptance
with synthetic data. The release includes the MSI, matching source, checksums
and an [acceptance summary](https://github.com/townlight/townlight/releases/download/townlight-windows-v1.7.2.1/ACCEPTANCE-Windows-1.7.2.1.md).
Earlier releases retain their original identities and acceptance evidence. City-specific policies, staff and equipment still
require commissioning. Station uses a pinned CivicCast media implementation;
standalone CivicCast remains a separate product. Current owned code and manuals
are AGPL-3.0-only, with retained historical grants and vendor notices.

The current Windows acceptance covers the paired-loopback Meetings → Station → Records handoff using a synthetic recorded file. Historical Station delivery evidence does not establish live broadcast, external upload or city deployment acceptance for this MSI.


## Separately deployed resident portal beta

[Portal release and downloads](https://github.com/townlight/townlight/releases/tag/townlight-beta-1-resident-portal) · [Portal guide](https://townlight.github.io/manuals/portal.html). Includes the approved city-facing website and the Meetings → Station → Records publication workflow. Deploy the portal and matching native bridge separately; the portal and bridge use their own release and deployment steps. Acceptance uses synthetic data; CivicCast remains separate.
